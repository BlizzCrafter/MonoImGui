# Welcome to MonoImGui!

This template project makes it easier to start a new **MonoGame** tool with **ImGui.NET**, **Serilog** and **FontAwesome** integrations.

It contains some very basic stuff, so you need to update everything to your needs.

Also please don't forget to update the **AppSettings.cs** class with your own info or alternatively remove it.

# Usage

1. Simply click on "Use this template" in the upper right corner on the GitHub page.
2. Then choose "Create a new repository".
3. Done! - A new repo with a fresh commit history will be created for you.

# Now have fun using MonoImGui!

Have a nice day! üòé
